# Currently Broken - Do Not Use

Looks like SXM patched this method.

I will update this repo if I ever find a work around.

Thank you all. Remember, sharing is caring.

# Info

SXM Activator PWA

Proof of concept, quick and dirty PWA to activate satellite radios on a trial account.

Using this PWA you understand what you are doing, this PWA comes with no warranty or liability for what you do with it.

Inspired by https://github.com/parker-stephens/siriusxm-activator

# Version

On Oct-19-2022 I added in a version indicator just below the logo on the "Enter Radio ID" page, use this to ensure you're running the latest version at all times.

Current version: 1.0.5

# How to use

Go to https://xisonc.github.io/sxm-activator-pwa/ to try it.

This is a fully installable PWA, so feel free to install it on your device.

You can also download and run the app locally using Firefox or Chrome, download the ZIP file, extract the files, and open index.html in your web browser.

# Note

This app funnels requests through a CORS-anywhere proxy to allow it to work client side. The app will detect if you need to activate the demo mode of the CORS proxy automatically, just follow the instructions.
